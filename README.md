This is an ancient fork for django-survey from http://code.google.com/p/django-survey/

It is maintained here now just for our reference purposes. No one should use this.  You should check out the real deal or any of a dozen more modern survey packages for django out there.

From the original project:

Create simple surveys with public or private results in seconds. Question types can be added externally, and the system is extensible.

The current native answer types are:

Text Input
Text Area
Select One Choice
Radio List
Radio Image List
Checkbox List
More will be coming shortly.
